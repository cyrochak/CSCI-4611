/** An AnimatedCharacter combines a hierarchical Skeleton of bones with one or
 more Poses that specify how the bones are currently positioned in space.  The
 Poses can be stored in the form of a MotionClip, and this allows for animated
 playback.  Example:
 ~~~
 AnimatedCharacter bob;
 MotionClip jump_motion;
 
 void MyGraphicsApp::InitOpenGL() {
    std::vector<std::string> search_path;
    search_path.push_back("./data");

    // Load a skeleton for bob
    bob.LoadSkeleton(Platform::FindFile("bob.asf", search_path));
   
    // Load a walking motion and tell bob to start playing it back on repeat
    MotionClip walk1;
    walk1.LoadFromAMC(Platform::FindFile("human_walk.amc", searchPath_), bob.skeleton_ptr());
    bob.Play(walk1);
 
    // Load a jumping motion clip to use later...
    jump_motion.LoadFromAMC(Platform::FindFile("human_jump.amc", searchPath_), bob.skeleton_ptr());
 }
 
 void MyGraphicsApp::UpdateSimulation(double dt)  {
    // Advances bob to the next frame of the animation
    bob.AdvanceAnimation(dt);
 }
 
 void MyGraphicsApp::DrawUsingOpenGL() {
    // Draws bob using his current pose (i.e., whatever pose was setup during
    // the last call to bob.AdvanceAnimation()
    bob.Draw(model_matrix, view_matrix, proj_matrix);
 }
 
 void MyGraphicsApp::OnButtonPressed() {
    // Imagine we want bob to jump every time a button is pressed, this overlays
    // a jumping mocap clip on top of bob's current motion.  Once the jump is
    // played back once, bob returns to his previous motion.
    bob.OverlayClip(jump_motion, 50);

     motion clip.  Use this to apply new behaviors on command.  In a game where
     you press the 'A' button to punch, you could call this function to overlay
     a punching motion clip on top of the current base motion of the character.
     We call this an "overlay" rather than simply "insert" because the function
     also interpolates between the current motion clip and the overlay clip so 
     that there is a smooth transition in the motion.  You can control how smooth
     the transition is by setting the num_transition_frames parameter.  A larger
     number will create a longer, smoother transition.  num_transition_frames are
     used both to "fade in" the overlay motion and to "fade it out".  If you have
     an overlay_clip that is 300 frames long and num_transition_frames=50, then
     the first 50 frames of the overlay_clip will be blended with the next 50
     frames of the motion clip that the character is currently using.  Then, the
     middle 200 frames of the overlay_clip will be played on their own.  Then,
     the final 50 frames of the overlay_clip will again be blended with the next
     50 frames of the character's current motion clip to "fade out" the overlay.

     on the real-world elapsed time, and is determined by the character's frames
     per second (fps).  For example, if the character is set to have a fps=120,
     and the dt since the last frame is 1/120 seconds, then the character will
     advance 1 frame.  If the fps=120 and the dt=1/60, then the character will

# CSci-4611 Assignment 3:  Earthquake
In this Assignment, we are creating a plane map and a sphere earth to show the earthquakes happened.
I managed to create my earow.th plane map using 10 X 10 slices and stacks.
I have set up all the indices and vertices to allow my map to sh
I have also worked on creating some marker about earthquakes
I have implemented LatLongToPlane() and LatLongToSphere() to allow the sphere to work with.

For the implementation of the marker, I use the magnitude is change the color of the marker, adjust the model matrix with scaling and translation and Draw the marker out with quick_shapes function.

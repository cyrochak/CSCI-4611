/** A triangle mesh data structure that can be rendered with a ShaderProgram
 like DefaultShader.  The mesh can be created algorithmically by adding triangles
 one at a time or it can be loaded from an .obj file.
 
 Vertices are required -- you cannot have a mesh without vertices, but other
 attributes (normals, colors, texture coordinates) are optional.  When Draw()
 is called the mesh will automatically set these other attributes if available.
 
 Example of loading from a file:
 ~~~
 // during initialization
 Mesh m;
 m.LoadFromOBJ(Platform::FindMinGfxDataFile("teapot.obj"));
 // also create a shader to draw it.
 DefaultShader s;
 
 
 // later to draw
 Matrix4 M;
 Matrix4 V = Matrix4::LookAt(Point3(0,0,3), Point3(0,0,0), Vector3(0,1,0));
 Matrix4 P = Matrix4::Perspective(60.0, aspect_ratio(), 0.1, 10.0);
 s.Draw(M, V, P, m, DefaultShader::MaterialProperties());
 ~~~
 
 Example of creating a mesh algorithmically:
 ~~~
 Mesh mesh1;
 int tri_id;
 // add a first triangle
 tri_id = mesh1.AddTriangle(Point3(0,0,0), Point3(1,0,0), Point3(1,1,0));
 // set attributes for the vertices
 mesh1.SetNormals(tri_id, Vector3(0,0,1), Vector3(0,0,1), Vector3(0,0,1));
 mesh1.SetTexCoords(tri_id, 0, Point2(0,1), Point2(1,1), Point2(1,0));

 // add a second triangle and attributes
 tri_id = mesh1.AddTriangle(Point3(0,0,0), Point3(1,1,0), Point3(0,1,0));
 mesh1.SetNormals(tri_id, Vector3(0,0,1), Vector3(0,0,1), Vector3(0,0,1));
 mesh1.SetTexCoords(tri_id, 0, Point2(0,1), Point2(1,0), Point2(0,0));
 
 // call this when done to save to the GPU
 mesh1.UpdateGPUMemory();
 
 // then you can draw the same way as in the previous example.
 ~~~
 In the mode used above where you add one triangle at a time there is no way to
 reuse vertices in multiple triangles.  If you need to do this for efficiency
 or other reasons, then you can use an indexed faces mode where you set the
 mesh data structures directly.
 
 Example of creating a mesh that renders in an indexed faces mode:
 ~~~
 std::vector<unsigned int> indices;
 std::vector<Point3> vertices;
 std::vector<Vector3> normals;
 std::vector<Point2> texcoords;

 // four vertices, each requires 3 floats: (x,y,z)
 vertices.push_back(Point3(0,0,0));
 vertices.push_back(Point3(1,0,0));
 vertices.push_back(Point3(1,1,0));
 vertices.push_back(Point3(0,1,0));

 // four normals, each requires 3 floats: (x,y,z)
 normals.push_back(Vector3(0,0,1));
 normals.push_back(Vector3(0,0,1));
 normals.push_back(Vector3(0,0,1));
 normals.push_back(Vector3(0,0,1));

 // four texture coords, each requires 2 floats: (u,v)
 texcoords.push_back(Point2(0,1));
 texcoords.push_back(Point2(1,1));
 texcoords.push_back(Point2(1,0));
 texcoords.push_back(Point2(0,0));
 
 // indices into the arrays above for the first triangle
 indices.push_back(0); 
 indices.push_back(1); 
 indices.push_back(2);
 
 // indices for the second triangle, note some are reused
 indices.push_back(0); 
 indices.push_back(2); 
 indices.push_back(3);
 
 Mesh mesh1;
 mesh1.SetVertices(vertices);
 mesh1.SetNormals(normals);
 mesh1.SetTexCoords(0, texcoords);
 mesh1.SetIndices(indices);
 mesh1.UpdateGPUMemory();
 
 // then you can draw the same way as in the previous example.

Text Rain is an interactive with brightness that using their motions to play around with falling letters that acted like rain.

In my algorithm,I created an array list to store the letters that will be fall down. The array list is defined as a letter class that is created to store their position, velocity, time, and some functions that help with letter falling. For example, I have implemented a timesupdate() function that update the vertical position and the time, and the character that representing to.

Also, I have implemented gray scale that ensure the image is properly scale. As well as UP, Down, Space bar key, they are having functions to adjust the threshold during the actions. I have also done a flipping a image so that they acted like a mirror. In addition, I have made the letters to fall down randomly, so that it look like rain that do not have any patterns.
